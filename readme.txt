Stable tag: 1.0.0

This plugin helps you to find conflicts between plugins on a website that is already online.

== Description ==

With this plugin I hope to help all of those who get asked by a theme or plugin developer to disable plugins in order to find out if a reported issue is caused by a plugin conflict.

Especially when you only have a live site, this request is not easy to follow without an interruption or breaking visible features.

Therefore, Debug Plugin Conflicts allows you to disable specific plugins only when an admin user is visiting the frontend in order to debug it.

Also support staff can now give a practical advise to their users with a link to this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `debug-plugin-conflicts` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to 'Tools > Debug Plugins' to set up which plugins to test

**Instructions and important Notes**

Tested on multisites.

If you have an issue with the plugins not being activated correctly then remove mu-plugins/plugin-conflicts-mu.php.
